This repository include Robotic and Interactive Systems (SRI) courses and projects of UPSSITECH engineering school in France.

## What's UPSSITECH ?
**UPSSITECH is a French engineering school**.

Train engineers in 3 areas of specialization: 
* Civil Engineering and Geosciences (GCGEO),
* **Robotic and Interactive Systems (SRI),**
* Telecommunications Systems and Computer Networks (STRI).
To this end, it has a strong partnership policy with the academic and socio-economic world, in France and internationally, while continuing to increase its capacity and its training offer.

A very large majority of academic speakers is composed of **research professors** belonging to international research laboratories (**[LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/public/), [LAPLACE](https://www.laplace.univ-tlse.fr/), ...**). 
They guarantee the link between training and research. 
The scientific orientation of the specialties, even if it is in strong synergy with the industrial needs, is also guided by the themes and the know-how developed in the laboratories. 
An essential point of the training aims to strengthen the synergy and complementarity of professional and research objectives to meet the needs of innovation.

## Robotic and Interactive Systems speciality
### Objectives
The vocation of « Robotic and Interactive Systems » (SRI) is to train and certify engineers able to develop and deploy robotic and / or interactive systems (industrial, mobile, humanoid robots), integrating all functions of software necessary for their total or partial autonomy. These systems are at the center of the training and constitute the integration objects for the development of skills at the confluence of the Automatic, Real-Time Computing, and Artificial Intelligence.
The programming of these systems is articulated around the perception-decision-action triptych: multi-sensory perception, decision-making, reasoning and learning, planning of movement actions and sensorimotor control of robots, multimodal interaction … and their integration on cyber-physical systems that combine the virtual world of real-time computing with the real world of robots.

### Training
The Occitanie Region, particularly in « Le Grand Toulouse », is one of the most dynamic regions in France in the fields of Robotics, Human-Computer Interaction, and Artificial Intelligence. SRI training is fully integrated into this regional « training-research-industry » as well as the national and international ecosystems, It is characterized by:
* A fit with the expectations of employers and an effective industrial partnership, especially with the network of former graduated SRI students, Robotics Place and Digital Place clusters for their opportunities for internships, and employment. The apprenticeship training is thus possible for the students of the training in the last year of the course (2nd year of the master degree).
* An international experience through mobility opportunities in semesters and / or internships (laboratories, companies) in Europe, Japan, South and Central America, Australia, etc.
* An innovative approach to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence thanks to teaching courses mainly taught by research professors from the LAAS-CNRS and IRIT research laboratories, and thanks to a strong project-based approach to decompartmentalize the taught disciplines.

### Sectors and trades
SRI trains and certifies the following professions in the fields of embedded and industrial robotics and human-computer interaction: systems validation engineer, software developer, software designer.
The targeted sectors are high-technology industries and services in industrial production, embedded systems, land transportation, recreation, computer services, health, agriculture, defense and security.
