# 2023-2025-UPSSITECH

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the UPSSITECH 2023-2025 program, which focuses on **Robotic and Interactive Systems** (SRI). This repository contains my coursework, notes, projects, and resources from the program, emphasizing the development and deployment of robotic and interactive systems integrating **Automatic Control, Real-Time Computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. The SRI program trains engineers in developing autonomous systems, focusing on multi-sensory perception, decision-making, reasoning, learning, motion planning, and sensorimotor control for their application in sectors such as **industrial robotics, humanoid robotics**, and human-computer interaction.

## Repository Structure

- `1st_year (Licence 3)`: First-year coursework.
- `2nd_year (Master 1)`: Second-year coursework.
- `3rd_year (Master 2)`: Third-year coursework.
- `resources`: Documents and materials related to the program.

## Training Highlights

- **Industry Integration**: Strong partnerships with industry and alumni networks like Robotics Place and Digital Place, facilitating internships and employment opportunities.
- **International Experience**: Mobility opportunities for internships and semesters abroad (Europe, Japan, South and Central America, Australia, etc.), including my international semester at [PPKE University (Budapest, Hungary)](https://github.com/acromtech/PPKE_International_Semester) and an internship that involves to create a [Generic NIR wirstband for Bionics application]().
- **Innovative Teaching**: Courses primarily taught by research professors from [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/en/) and [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/), with a strong project-based approach.

## Sectors and Professions

The SRI program prepares students for careers in **embedded and industrial robotics and human-computer interaction**. Graduates typically pursue roles such as systems validation engineers, software developers, and software designers in high-tech industries, including industrial production, embedded systems, transportation, healthcare, agriculture, defense, and security.
